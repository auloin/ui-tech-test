# Technical test 👩‍🔬


Welcome to the technical test 👋. 

The goal of this test is to measure your frontend development skills in a realistic setting. You're about to build a mini form builder with some of the technologies we use at Tiro.health. The challenge is divided in several tasks and you'll notice that each task description has some links to usefull documentation that may help if you're not familiar with the tech we use.

## Getting started with the test

### Fork this repository
Fork this repository on GitHub to start developping on your own account.
This repository supports *Github CodeSpaces*. If you have issues setting up your environment, know that your can launch VSCode in your browser directly from GitHub through Github CodeSpaces without the need to configure the environment.

### Setup the Environment
This application uses Vite to transpile React + TypeScript.

Make sure you have install `yarn`, if not, follow the installation instructions: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Overview of the folder structure

- `/src/components` -> contains components that may be used in multiple places
- `/src/components/fields` -> contains components to render the differen Fields
- `/src/pages/` -> components that render the pages of this application
- `/src/App.tsx` -> the root level component
- `/src/country-service.ts` -> a funtion that fetches data on countries with the ability to filter on country name.

### During the test

1. Try to use the documentation when you're not familiar with a particular technology.
2. Commit regularly. This way we can reconstruct how you proceeded through the tasks.
3. If you have questions: send an email or open a GitHub issue on this project. I'll try to respond ASAP.

### When you're ready with the test

1. Make sure you have commited and pushed all your changes.
2. Initiate a Pull Request on GitHub. I'll review your PR and add comments to your code.

Good luck 💪🏻

## The Challenges
Next section goes over the list of challenges that you need to solve. 
Most of them do not have to be solved in order. So don't hesitate to skip and proceed with the next one if your stuck.

🔗 Each task has a list of resources that link to the documentation of relevant packages. Use these links, they might help you on the right track if you're lost.

### Create an edit and preview mode 
⏳ Estimated time 10 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `components/ModeSwitch/useMode.ts`, `components/ModeSwitch/ModeSwitch.tsx`  

Noticed the switch button in the "Designer" page? This switch button is meant toggle between "Edit" and "Preview" mode but unfortunatly it doesn't work. The problem is that it is based on local state hook: `useReducer`. 

We want this piece of state to be part of the URL as a query parameter and expose it as a hook with the same interface.

➡️ **Re-implement the `useMode` hook so it that is synchronised with the URL Search paramete `mode`**

- `/designer?mode=edit` shoud put you in "Edit Mode"
- `/designer?mode=preview` should put you in "Preview Mode"
- `/other` should put you in "Preview Mode"

### Create a sidebar with property forms for the fields 
⏳ Estimated time 20 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `components/Aside.tsx`, `components/useAside.tsx` 

Each field in the Form Buidler has some properties. <br/>➡️ **The goal of this task is to make these properties editable through a form that is rendered in the sidepanel `<aside />`.** 

Take a look at the TypeScript definition of the field in [`useField.ts`](./src/components/useFields.ts), each attribute (except `id`) should be configurable through a form. Bonus points if you can make the form submit automatically when the user has made it's changes without clicking on the submit button. This way you can hide the submit button. 
We'll create the `onSubmit` handler in next task so you can just put `console.log` as the handler of the Form Submit event.

Make sure that the end-user can click on a field to highlight it and edit it's properties in the sidepanel. For this you'll need the code in `SelectionManager.tsx` and complete it further to a fully functional `useSelection` hook.
The goal of the `useSelection` hook is to keep track of the selected field by storing it's id. Based on this `isSelected` state you can highlight the selected field and show it's corresponding properties form.

### Implement an update field handler 
⏳ Estimated time 15 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `components/fields/useFields.tsx`

Currently the `useFields` hook has a very naïve implementation. It just returns the `INIT_FIELDS`. In this task we'll connect this hook to a global store that holds the fields using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). 


➡️ **Create a Zustand store with a `fields` attribute holding the form fields**.<br/> The store should accept field updates so that you can pass it to the Form Submit handler from previous task. Make sure to also pass the updates of the `<Label />` to the update handler you've just created.

If you weren't able to complete previous step, make sure to implement an update field that matches the following TypeScript type:
```TypeScript
type UpdateFn = (field:Partial<Field>, index: number) => void
```

Editing the properties of a field is nice but a real form builder can also add and remove fields.<br/>
➡️ **Extend the store you've created by adding an *add* and *remove* field handler**.<br/>
If you're ready make sure to bind these the add handler to the buttons in the bottom of the FormBuilder and the remove handler to the *Trash*-button of the fields.

### Add a new field type: the country combobox
⏳ Estimated time 30 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `pages/Designer/Designer.tsx`, `components/fields/useFields`, and new file(s) 😁

We need an extra field component for Country input.
Instead of using a simple text input for the users to enter their country of birth, we want a combobox that's generating suggestions.<br/>
➡️ **Create a new field type `country` and implement a Combobox using the [components provided by HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/react/combobox).**<br/>
Use the `findCountries` function from `country-service.ts` to return a list of countries given a query:

```Typescript 
import findCountries, { Country } from "../country-service"
```

You can use TanStack Query integrate the async `filterCountries` fetch function in your component.

### Form Filler and Response
⏳ Estimated time 20 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `App.tsx`,`pages/Response/Response.tsx`, `components/fields/useFields`

Now the Form Builder is useable, we need to render the form in a seperate page so end-users can fill it in.
<br/>➡️ **The goal of this task is to create a Form Filler and Form Response page.**<br/>
Copy the `<Designer/>` page and remove all designer related functionality. Leverage the data router capabilities of [React Router to handle Form submissions](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/form) to pass the data to the Form Response page. The Form Response should only give read-only view of the entered data.

### Drag and Drop fields
⏳ Estimated time 20 min <br/>
📂 Important files: `pages/Designer/Designer.tsx`,`components/fields/FieldWrapper.tsx`,`components/fields/useFields.ts` 

Finally, we want to enable the users to move fields arround by using drag-and-drop interactions. The native Drag and Drop API is hard to use so luckily their are libraries to help us.

➡️ **Implement drag-and-drop on the fields by using *dnd-kit*s `useSortable` hook**
You won't have a handler yet for the `onDragEnd` event, so just use a `console.log`.

Once the drag-and-drop interaction is ready, we need to persist the new order of the fields in our zustand Form store. If you didn't manage to built the store, you'll need to skip this part.

➡️ **Extend the form store with a `move` method that updates the order of the fields in the store**
